# ZIP-Identification
A simple project

**Objective:**
I assisted my friend with a school project aimed at identifying ZIP codes with the highest and lowest volatility in prices over the past five years. The project also explored the key drivers of volatility for the year 2022, with a focus on how prices varied over time.

**Data:**
The analysis utilized data from the Zillow Observed Rent Index (ZORI) and Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI), both based on ZIP codes (similar to postal codes in Canada). Additionally, economic and demographic data for 2022 from Altus Group were incorporated.

**Note:** This project was a bit challenging and still ** imperfect and imcomplete**, but it was an exciting and rewarding experience to support my friend and work through the complexities together. Iâ€™m writing this down as a cherished memory! ðŸ˜Š
